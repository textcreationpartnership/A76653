            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THere is ſcarce any part of Holy Writ, which hath met with a more ſevere entertainment in the World, than this Sacred Book: For although it hath evident Characters of its Divine Authority, and more Humane Teſtimony, than any other Book of the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> yet upon the increaſe of the <hi>Millenary Controverſies</hi> in the Church; it was firſt called in queſtion, and then boldly, and impiouſly rejected, by that party, whoſe Sentiments it opppoſed, until they had found out a way of reconciling it unto them. Into ſuch extravagancies will immoderate oppoſition tranſport men, and a fond Love, and heady Zeal for private Fancies and Opinions! Neither have thoſe who have endeavoured to illuſtrate, and clear the difficulties of this Myſterious Book, met with leſs gentle uſage in theſe latter ages, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb facs="tcp:136239:3"/> from thoſe of our own Nation; but have been commonly repreſented as Frantick Zealots, and Crazed Enthuſiaſts; or where ſuch Characters could not be faſtned on them; they have been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally depreſſed in the World, if their Sentiments proved contrary to what was moſt prevailing in it; to the great diſcouragement of inquiſitive Perſons, and to the mighty hindrance of Truth, and Knowledg; which never thrive better than under a gentle, and moderate freedom. And therefore, I cannot but regret (although it be to the Diſhonour of my own Nation) the hard fate of thoſe two excellent Perſons, Mr. <hi>Potter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> the former of whom, although ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably skilled in many abſtruſe parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet lived, and dyed in an obſcure retirement, in a remote corner of the Land; whilſt the other (the Ornament of our Church, and of the Age he lived in) was never able ſo much as to keep a Horſe for Health, not State, which was the heighth of his ambition. And I wiſh I could ſay, that we were grown more favourable to ſuch diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that ſo a conſiderable perſon, of deep Thought, and of great inſight into Myſterious Truths, (upon whoſe <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is chiefly grounded, after much doubt, and tryal of it) might not be permitted to ſtruggle with adverſity, and lie under the depreſſing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb facs="tcp:136239:3"/> of Reſtraint. But, alas, I fear that (like the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 9.33.</note> when he deſired the continuance of the Glory of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s transgfiurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon this Earth,) we <hi>know not what we ſay,</hi> when we wiſh that ſuch men had met with greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages in the World, as the preſent ſtate of it is; and that we ought not <hi>to ſeek</hi>

               <hi>great things for our ſelves,</hi> or others, whilſt the Church is in a <hi>Sack-cloath State,</hi> and Condition; but that our Souls are to be ſuited to God's Diſpenſations, and we are not to aim at high things, in the times of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick calamities. And whoſoever makes this uſe of privacy, and adverſity; may ſooner meet with Divine Viſitations, and comforts in the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure corner; and with Spiritual Illuminations in a <hi>Patmos,</hi> or a <hi>Priſon;</hi> than amidſt the greateſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the enjoyments of this World; and all the advantages of great Parts, many Books, and much Learning; which too often ſwell the mind, and <hi>puff up,</hi> more <hi>than edifie;</hi> whereas the chief qualifications (next to Prayer, and the Divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) to the attaining to Knowledg in this, or any other part of Scripture, are Humility, Induſtry, and Patience in ſearching; and a ready ſubmiſſion to
<pb facs="tcp:136239:4"/> Convictions, although they prove contrary to our former thoughts, and our preſent intereſt. For great application of Mind, is neceſſary to ſearch into the bottom of Myſterious Truths; and a man who would underſtand the Will of God in this Prophecy; muſt during the Study of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Parties, and Prejudices; and diveſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his former Principles, although never ſo deeply rooted, and never ſo ſeemindy rational; and cloſely follow that Senſe, which appears to be the meaning of the Holy Spirit. <hi>For God's Thoughts, are not as our Thoughts;</hi> and men of the greateſt ſtrength of Reaſon, when they happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on falſe Principles, and too ſtrictly adhere to them, are of all others the moſt irreclaimable. It were eaſy to ſhew that <hi>Alcaſar</hi> (who ſpent twenty Years in the Study of this Prophecy) <hi>Ribera,</hi> and other very Learned, and Judicious Men amongſt the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> had ſcarcely miſſed of many great Truths, if they had not been of that Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that ſeveral truly great and good Men among the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> were miſled by a too fond reſpect for ſome private Principles: Such as were, the impoſſibility that ſo groſs an Idolatry, and ſo Univerſal an Apoſtaſy, as is ſuppoſed in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; ſhould ever be permitted to overſpread the Face of the Viſible Church, which yet is ſuppoſed ſhould actually come to paſs towards the
<pb facs="tcp:136239:4"/> end of the Word, by <hi>Ribera,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:136239:5"/> of Mind, impartial Search, and univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; which were joyned in him, with a rare, and uncommon mixture, of ſlowneſs, and yet large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thought. I am not ignorant, that many excellent perſons, who have ſhaken off the fetters of Prejudice, and Education; and have too great Souls to he confined within the narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a Party, or a private Intereſt; are yet very a verſe to the Writings of thoſe, who offer at the Interpretation of Prophetical Scripture, if their ſentiments ſeem to look with a too cloſe, and threatning Aſpect upon the Age they live in: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the frequent falſity of ſuch pretences; and the ill influence they may have (eſpecially at ſome times, and ſeaſons) upon the publick peace of Church and State. And indeed, they are not to be blamed for being cautious, and watchful over ſuch Pretenders; eſpecially at a time, and in a Nation ſo prone to <hi>Enthuſiaſm;</hi> and ſo eaſily tranſported into irregular Practiſes, upon any new, or unuſual Occurrence. But although due cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be commendable; yet a ſettled averſion to, or a careleſs neglect of ſearching into Scripture Prophecies, may be of as ill effect to the Publick, as the Confidence of falſe Pretenders to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them, or the raſhneſs of the giddy Multitude can poſſibly be: And I cannot ſee what excuſe Learned Men can have, for not weighing
<pb facs="tcp:136239:5"/> and conſidering, what is offered from <hi>Scripture, Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> towards the clearing up of that <hi>Prophecy,</hi> to the Study of which, the reward of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> is promiſed in it. Raſhneſs, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Confidence, and pretences to immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, when not agreeable to <hi>Scripture,</hi> or <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> are indeed to be Deſpiſed; and it is fit that even thoſe who propagate <hi>Truths</hi> after a Turbulent and Zelotick manner, ſhould be reſtrained; but when things, which may ſeem ſomething ſtrange, and uncommon, are offered by Men of <hi>Piety,</hi> and <hi>Learning,</hi> although with an Air of ſome more than ordinary aſſurance; it is very commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſearch into the grounds of them; and not wholly to ſlight them, although there may be a mixture of Frailty and Error in them: For God doth not now ordinarily aſſiſt after an infallible manner; and ſometimes permitted even his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>

From this Verſe we may obſerve the Order of Divine Revelation; which proceeds from God the Father, as the Fountain and Original; and is committed by him to Chriſt, unto whom all Power is given in the Church: by whom it is ſent to his Servants, eſpecially Miniſters, by the Miniſtration of his Angels, who are under him, as their Head and Lord; and his Miniſters, to whom the Prophecy is principally directed, are alſo ſtiled Angels, from their Miniſtring to him in this Prophecy, together with the Angels.

Only <hi>Christ</hi> at ſome certain ſeaſons puts in, as it were, his <hi>Claim to his Kingdom,</hi> by ſome more than ordinary Appearances of it. Now the Appearance here referred to, ſeems to be plainly, that of the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> under the <hi>Chriſtian Empire;</hi> which was the next remarkable Event after the Fall of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> deſcribed at the cloſe of the foregoing <hi>Chapter;</hi> and was ſo glorious a one, that it might juſtly be deſcribed by the State of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf; <hi>Paganiſm</hi> having been overthrown by it, the <hi>Church</hi> delivered from Perſecution, and exalted into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected, and ſudden State of Proſperity, and <hi>the Man of Sin withheld</hi> for ſome time, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.6, 7. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cxuſe this glorious State of things would not continue long in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:136239:77"/> purity, but would be ſoon corrupted by Pride and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and by the bringing in of <hi>Pagan</hi> Rites into the <hi>Church,</hi> under the Specious Pretences of a well-meaning Prudence, and Zeal: therefore it pleaſed God, to give an intimation of this early Corruption, by ſealing a <hi>pure Church,</hi> even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he gives the <hi>glorious appearance</hi> of the <hi>Viſible Church;</hi> that a competent Number of <hi>ſealed Witneſſes might be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,</hi> and <hi>preſerved betimes</hi> in <hi>purity and integrity;</hi> before their Minds could be corrupted by the Glory and Honours of this <hi>Exalted Church;</hi> and by the <hi>Myſtery of iniquity,</hi> which had been working in ſecret for a long time, and was advanced to a Satanical Synagogue, even in the foregoing times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution.</p>
